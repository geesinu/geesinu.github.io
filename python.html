        <h4>A Breif History of Python</h4>
        <p class = "p1"> 
            Python is a widley used general purose, high level programming language
            It was initially designed by Guido van Rossum in 1991 and developed by Python Software Foundation. 
            It was mainly developed for emphasis on code readability, and its syntax allows programmers to express concepts in fewer lines of code. 
            <li class = "li1">
                
                The work on Python began in the late 1980s. It first started out as a hobby as Guido Van Rossum was looking for something to keep him 
                pre-occupied during christmas. Python is said to have succeeded ABC programming language, which Guido helped create. He used his experience 
                on working with ABC to develop the syntax structure of python. He worked on what users disliked about the syntax and worked to impove it fro pytho.
                The  language was finally released in 1991. When it was released, it used a lot fewer codes to express the concepts, when we compare it with Java, C++ & C.
                Its design philosophy was quite good too. Its main objective is to provide code readability and advanced developer productivity.

                        <li>
                            While writing a software application, you must focus on the quality of its source code to simplify maintenance and updates. 
                            The syntax rules of Python allow you to express concepts without writing additional code. 
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            At the same time, Python, unlike other programming languages, emphasizes on code readability, and allows you to use English keywords instead of punctuations. 
                            Hence, you can use Python to build custom applications without writing additional code. 
                        </li>

                         <li>   
                            The readable and clean code base will help you to maintain and update the software without putting extra time and effort. 
                        </li>

                    <p>
                        <li>
                            At present, Python is supports many operating systems. You can even use Python interpreters to run the code on specific platforms and tools.
                            Two main operating systems pythin runs on are "windows" and "MacOS".
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            Also, Python is an interpreted programming language. It allows you to you to run the same code on multiple platforms without recompilation. Hence, you are not required to recompile the code after making any alteration.
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            You can run the modified application code without recompiling and check the impact of changes made to the code immediately.

            Some Other key features are:
            <ul class = "ul1">
                <li>
                    Multiple Programming Paradigms: Python also supports several programming paradigm. It supports object oriented and structured programming fully. Also, its language features support various concepts in functional and aspect-oriented programming. 
                    At the same time, Python also features a dynamic type system and automatic memory management. The programming paradigms and language features help you to use Python for developing large and complex software applications.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Simplify Complex Software Development: Python is a general purpose programming language. Hence, you can use the programming language for developing both desktop and web applications.
                    Also, you can use Python for developing complex scientific and numeric applications. Python is designed with features to facilitate data analysis and visualization. 
                    You can take advantage of the data analysis features of Python to create custom big data solutions without putting extra time and effort.
                    Many Python developers even use Python to accomplish artificial intelligence (AI) and natural language processing tasks.

                <p class = "p4">
                    Once You have Downloaded your Python Integrated Development Environment (IDE) 
                    you will have all you need to strat coding. What I would like to walk you through 
                    is your very first programme known as "hello world":
                        
                    
                        <li class = "hello">The line of code is: print ("Hello World!")</li>
                 
                <p class = "p4"> 
                   Thats it, Very short right. But this is a gateway to the world of coding. 
                   As you can see we have used a function called 'print' which takes the input "hello world"
                   and outputs it into the console. Try changing the input and see what happens!
